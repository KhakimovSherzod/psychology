// i have to implement PIN reset feature in the backend and frontend parts.
// also in frontend and backend it has been implemented partially
// but it changes pin in settings with uuid but in login its not possible
// because it requires uuid and uuid does not have who wants to
// implement reset pin or unify it with changepin feature
